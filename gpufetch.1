.SH SYNOPSIS
.B gpufetch
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
Simple yet fancy GPU architecture fetching tool
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-color\fR
Sets the color scheme (by default, gpufetch uses the system color scheme) See COLORS section for a more detailed explanation
.TP
\fB\-g\fR, \fB\-\-gpu\fR
Selects the GPU to use (default: 0)
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Prints gpufetch version and exit
.SS "COLORS:"
.IP
Color scheme can be set using a predefined color scheme or a custom one:
1. To use a predefined color scheme, the name of the scheme must be provided. Possible values are:
* "nvidia":  Use NVIDIA default color scheme
2. To use a custom color scheme, 4 colors must be given in RGB with the format: R,G,B:R,G,B:...
The first 2 colors are the GPU art color and the following 2 colors are the text colors
.SS "EXAMPLES:"
.IP
Run gpufetch with NVIDIA color scheme:
.IP
\&./gpufetch \fB\-\-color\fR nvidia
.IP
Run gpufetch with a custom color scheme:
.IP
\&./gpufetch \fB\-\-color\fR 239,90,45:210,200,200:100,200,45:0,200,200

Peak performance information is NOT accurate. gpufetch computes peak performance using the max
frequency. However, to properly compute peak performance, you need to know the frequency of the
GPU running real code.
For peak performance measurement see: https://github.com/Dr\-Noob/peakperf
